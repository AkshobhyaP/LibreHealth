This is an Android application for mothers and guardians of newborn babies in Kenya to receive and display birth information and elements of essential newborn care, such as immunization records. This is a proof of concept for my proposal for GSoC 2020 under the organistaion LibreHealth. All the registered children are dummy data for diplaying the working of apllication.
